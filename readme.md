## Welcome to Show me the Money!

Tired of trying to figure out how much money we *really* have been spending at college, we decided to make an app that helps us better understand exactly how much money is in our accounts.

This app uses Apple's ARKit to show physical representations of the balance of your account. It will also show you recent purchases and a comparision of your account's deposits and withdrawals.
